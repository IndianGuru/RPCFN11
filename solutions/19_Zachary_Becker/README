initialize function gives a few options. You can specify the dimensions
of the board, and you can specify if you want the board to wrap around
to the other side.

evolve simply iterates though the state array and uses the rules to
determine if it should change states.

randomize_game_state is in a separate function, so it can easily be
called if desired.

is_alive returns false if you give it a cell off the board. Also you
can specify an origin cell and check a cell's state relative to it with
optional parameters.

count_neighbours simply counts all the alive cells around a particular
cell, using alive relative feature to simplify this.

update_dimensions if you set the state to an arbitrary array, this 
method can be called to properly set the width and height. It uses the
smallest column height to avoid problems.
